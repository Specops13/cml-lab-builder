# Changelog

All notable changes to ENCOR Lab Builder. Versions follow `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-10-17
### Added
- **Solution summary.** New `solution_summary` lab field (Markdown: root cause, the exact fix per device, why it works).
  It appears automatically when a Check scores 100%. Below 100%, **Reveal solution** (after a confirm) shows it together
  with the solution config per device. Labs without one get a summary generated from their solution config.
- **Progressive hints.** A **Hint** button next to Check reveals the next hint in order ("Hint 2 of 3").
  Hints come from the new lab-level `hints` list, or from the per-check hints. Revealed hints are remembered per lab in the
  browser and cleared on Reset. The results history records the hints used.
- CLI: `solution <lab>`, `hint <lab> [N]`, `check --hints-used N`. `check` prints the solution summary at 100%.
- Solution summaries and hints for all 11 built-in labs and both example packs.
- New example pack **troubleshoot-ospf-7node**: a trouble ticket on a 7-router multi-area OSPF network with one planted fault.
- **Ready-to-run builds** (PyInstaller one-folder) for Windows x64 and Linux x64 (glibc 2.28+), with a desktop launcher.
  The launcher uses a free port (8765 by default), opens the browser, detects an already running copy and passes CLI commands through.
  Build scripts live in `packaging/`, and a CI workflow builds and smoke-tests both bundles.
- UI version check: a banner appears if a cached script is out of date or the app was updated while the tab was open.
- The validator warns when a lab has no `solution_summary` or no hints. The authoring guide and AI prompt now require a summary.
### Fixed
- Markdown rendering: consecutive lines are joined into one paragraph (soft wrap) instead of one paragraph per line.

## [1.3.1]
### Fixed
- After upgrading, a stale browser cache could leave the UI with dead buttons and no labs.
  Asset URLs are now versioned (`?v=<version>`) and every response is sent with `Cache-Control: no-cache`.
### Changed
- The frontend is more resilient: each startup step runs separately, a visible error banner reports failed requests
  and script errors, and `/api/labs` reports a broken lab instead of failing as a whole.
- Explicit MIME types for static files and UTF-8 everywhere (Windows).
- README: Diagnostics section (hard refresh, F12 console).

## [1.3.0]
### Added
- Help icons with tooltips for every control: hover delay, keyboard focus, Esc to close, dark mode.
  All help text lives in `help.json`, and a test makes sure every interactive control has help. A *Show help icons* setting turns them off.
### Fixed
- Raw `%if0%` placeholders no longer appear anywhere a user can see them (task preview, grading results).

## [1.2.x and earlier]
- 1.2.0: the 10 staged labs are enabled, each with live and config checks.
  Also added user labs (import/export `.encorlab` packs, drag-and-drop), the Lab builder (form + YAML, check templates,
  import from CML, offline and live tests), strict offline validation, and the AI prompt plus an optional OpenAI-compatible generator.
- Example pack `ospf-multiarea-stub`. Easier import (drop files anywhere, replace prompt).
- Launchers pick a supported Python (3.10-3.13) and recreate an unsupported `.venv`.
- Two grading modes (live over the CML console server, config over HTTPS) with *auto* fallback, and per-check modes.
- First release: the `eigrp-basic` lab, CML 2.9 build/check/reset/destroy, web UI and CLI, IOL default with IOSv option.
